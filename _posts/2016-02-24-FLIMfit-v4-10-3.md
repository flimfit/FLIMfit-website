title: FLIMfit v4.10.3
---

We are pleased to announce the release of version 4.10.3 of the high-speed open-source Fluorescence Lifetime fitting and visualisation tool FLIMfit.

New Features

  * Support for Picoquant FIFO file formats .ptu and .pt3
  * Estimation of a Gaussian IRF from a reference measurement

There have been substantial changes “under the hood” including updated C++ compilers and a new build system in addition to a number of bug fixes.

FLIMfit now uses Matlab R2015b; Mac users please note that you will need to update the Matlab MCR to the [corresponding version for R2015b](http://au.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/?refresh=true).
