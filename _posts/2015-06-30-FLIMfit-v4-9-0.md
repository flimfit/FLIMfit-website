title: FLIMfit v4.9.0
---

This is to announce the release of version 4.9.0 of the high-speed open-source Fluorescence Lifetime fitting and visualisation tool FLIMfit.
This version is compatible with OMERO 5.1 servers and takes advantage of recent improvements to the Bio-Formats library.

The OMERO interface has also been improved to give the user full control when importing results from FLIMfit directly to the server.
An option has also been added to export false-colour fitted lifetime results to Icy http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/ for 3D visualisation.

Minor changes include:

 * Further improvements to handling of “empty” images (where all data falls below the chosen threshold).
