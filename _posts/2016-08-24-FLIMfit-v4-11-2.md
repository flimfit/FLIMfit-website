title: FLIMfit v4.11.2
---

We are pleased to announce the release of version 4.11.1 of the open-source Fluorescence Lifetime fitting and visualisation tool FLIMfit. [Download version 4.11.2 here](http://flimfit.org/downloads/4.11.2/).

Updates/Improvements
--------------------
* FLIMfit is now capable of handling some multi-dimensional file-sets. For example, if you have a real-time time-series of z-stacks, with one z-stack in each of several files, it can now be successfully loaded and processed.
* The "Files->Load FLIM Data" menu item now allows the user to select multiple files.
* The "Files->Load FLIM Dataset‚Äù menu item has been renamed, for clarity, to "Load FLIM Data from a Directory".
* The maximum number of segmented regions has been increased to 4095.
* Another waitbar has been added to make the workflow clearer when using large datasets.
* A method for estimating a Gaussian IRF from single-exponential reference data has been added 
* Loading Picoquant files created on MT200 systems is now supported

Bug Fixes
---------
* An issue with loading polarisation resolved IRFs, with different time points to the data, has been addressed 
* An issue with the loading of time-varying backgrounds has been addressed. 
* An issue loading time gated data with legacy file names has been addressed
