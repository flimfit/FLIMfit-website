title: FLIMfit v5.1.0
---

We are pleased to announce the release of version 5.1.0 of the open-source Fluorescence Lifetime fitting and visualisation tool FLIMfit, providing a number of new features and performance enhancements. [Download version 5.1.0 here](http://flimfit.org/downloads/5.1.0/).

**Please note that this version of FLIMfit uses Maximum Liklihood fitting by default. This is the best choice for TCSPC datasets.**

A guide to using FLIMfit for analysing multiphoton FLIM data with tutorial videos is available in a recent paper, [Conway, JRW, Warren, SC & Timpson, P, *Context-dependent intravital imaging of therapeutic response using intramolecular FRET biosensors,* Methods (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2017.04.014).

New Features
-------------------
- New phasor-plot based segmentation allows, for example, gating out of tissue autofluorescence
- Load motion-corrected FLIM data from Galene (http://galene.flimfit.org/)

Enhancements
-------------------
- Use Maximum Liklihood fitting by default
- Improved IRF estimation using photodiode model
- Load compressed B&H FIFO data with updated Bioformats
- Improve compatability with LaVision .ome.tifs
- Save colorscale limits in exported image metadata 

Bug fixes
-------------------
- Fix ability to load plain TIF stacks
- Fix regression in reference reconvolution
