---

Following on from the release of OMERO 5.1.3 and Bio-Formats 5.1.3 we are pleased to announce the release of version 4.9.1 of the high-speed open-source Fluorescence Lifetime fitting and visualisation tool FLIMfit.

In addition to the changes in Bio-Formats there have been a number of minor improvements with this release:

 * An option has been added to the segmentation controller to allow filtering by how close regions are to perfectly circular
 * The capability, when running on Windows, to write images directly into Powerpoint has been re-instated. (Tested on Win7 only.)
 * The total intensity in the selected decay is now displayed.
 * When the selected decay is from a single pixel, that pixels location in the image is also displayed
 * The max intensity in the integrated image is now also displayed.
 * The behaviour of the ROI selection controls has been modified to prevent multiple ROIs being selected.
